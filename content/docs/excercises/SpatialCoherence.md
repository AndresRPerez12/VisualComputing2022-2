## Problem statement
Light spatial coherence is a fenommenon of electromagnetic waves in which the correlation of amplitude values at different the wavefront are evaluated in order to determine and classify the current state of the wave thats being propagated. Does this affect color visualization?

## Background

* Temporal Coherence is a measure of the correlation of light wave’s phase at different points
along the direction of propagation – it tells us how monochromatic a source is.
* Spatial Coherence is a measure of the correlation of a light wave’s phase at different points
transverse to the direction of propagation - it tells us how uniform the phase of a wavefront is.

As waves (visible color light waves included) propagate through space, their amplitude magnitude and frequency varies ever so slightly both in a temporal and spatial manner.

These two measurements are not mutually exclusive, meaning that all waves can be different ammounts of spatially and temporally incoherent at the same time.

The important mathematical value evaluated is that of mutual coherence, that is, the correlation of two or more composing spectrums at a certain time.

## Conclusions
Spatial and temporal coherence explains through these correlations how colors and focus are altered both depending on distance and angles in which colors are observed, both because of diffussion of light and phase differences in the composing spectrums.
